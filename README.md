# SRM Attendance System

## Overview

The SRM Attendance System is a modern, web-based application designed for tracking and managing employee attendance in hybrid work environments. It allows employees to mark their work modes (Work From Office - WFO, Work From Home - WFH, Client Location - CLT, Paid Time Off - PTO) daily, view analytics, and manage profiles. Administrators can monitor overall attendance, generate reports, and access employee details.

The system supports role-based access with two user types:
- **Employees (User Role)**: Can mark/update attendance, view personal dashboard and timesheets, edit profiles, and change passwords.
- **Administrators (Admin Role)**: Have access to employee monitoring, leaderboard, full attendance reports, and summary statistics.

Key features include real-time attendance marking, calendar-based views, data analytics with charts, exportable reports, and a responsive UI optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (for frontend)
- **Java**: JDK 17 (for backend)
- **Maven**: 3.8+ (for backend build)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd srm_attendance
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   # No additional setup needed, Maven will download dependencies
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   - Backend runs on http://localhost:8081
   - API available at http://localhost:8081/auth, etc.

2. **Start the Frontend** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
   - Open in browser to access the application

   - For demo: Use "admin" as Employee ID to log in as admin
   - Sign up new users or log in with existing accounts

## API Documentation

The backend provides RESTful APIs. Key endpoints are listed above. Use tools like Postman for testing.

Example:
- Login: POST http://localhost:8081/auth/login with JSON body {"employeeId": "EMP123", "password": "password"}

## Database

Currently, the application uses in-memory storage, meaning data is lost on restart. When a persistent database is chosen (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), the DataStore can be replaced with JPA repositories.

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent database integration
- Real PDF/CSV export functionality
- Email notifications (e.g., forgot password)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app version
